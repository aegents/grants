## Summary
This proposal aims to develop the frontend functionality for agents in the ÆGENTS ecosystem. The functionality includes an **overview page** displaying all agents and an **individual agent page** featuring detailed sections such as charts, logic, balances, transactions, outputs, and logs. This will enhance the user experience by providing a comprehensive and organized interface for interacting with agents.

---

## Motivation
The frontend currently lacks specific functionality to display and manage agents. Adding these features will:
- Provide users with an intuitive and informative interface to view and interact with their agents.
- Enable detailed insights into individual agent performance and activity.
- Facilitate efficient navigation and data interaction, essential for scaling the ÆGENTS ecosystem.

## Technical Specification
1. **Overview Page**:
   - A grid or list view displaying all agents with key details such as name, performance metrics, and status.
   - Filter and search functionality to help users quickly locate specific agents.

2. **Individual Agent Page**:
   - **Chart View**:
     - Display agent performance over time (e.g., balances, transactions).
     - Use a library such as Chart.js or D3.js for interactive and responsive charts.
   - **Logic View**:
     - Present the agent’s logic and configurations in an organized format.
   - **Balances View**:
     - Show the agent’s wallet balances, including tokens and assets.
   - **Transactions View**:
     - List transactions with sortable columns (e.g., date, amount, type).
   - **Outputs View**:
     - Display outputs generated by the agent (e.g., reports, responses).
   - **Logs View**:
     - Show action logs in a paginated, searchable format.

3. **Reusable Components**:
   - Tables, lists, cards, and charts to ensure modularity and scalability.
   - Styling with TailwindCSS for rapid and consistent design.

4. **Integration with API**:
   - Connect with the ÆGENTS API to fetch data dynamically for agents.
   - Ensure efficient data caching and error handling for seamless user experience.

## Funding Request
- **Total Requested Amount**: 5,000,000 AEGNT
- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Develop the overview page for all agents (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully functional overview page with filtering and search functionality.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Implement individual agent page with chart and table components (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Chart view, balances view, and transactions view.
  3. **Milestone 3**: Finalize remaining views (logic, outputs, logs) and polish design (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Completed individual agent page, optimized performance, and user documentation.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Build the overview page with filtering, search, and API integration.
2. **Week 2**: Develop the chart, balances, and transactions views for individual agents.
3. **Week 3**: Finalize the logic, outputs, and logs views, and conduct usability testing.

## Impact
The frontend functionality for agents will:
- Enable users to efficiently view and manage all their agents.
- Provide comprehensive insights into agent activity and performance.
- Set the stage for more advanced features such as analytics and management tools.
- Strengthen the ÆGENTS ecosystem by enhancing usability and engagement.
