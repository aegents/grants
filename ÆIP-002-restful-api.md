## Summary
This proposal outlines the development of a robust API to load decentralized agent and launch data stored via IPFS/Filecoin and make it accessible for frontend applications. The API will follow best practices in blockchain and crypto infrastructure, ensuring security, scalability, and seamless integration with the ÆGENTS ecosystem.

---

## Motivation
With agent and launch data stored in decentralized storage, there is a need for a standardized, performant API to retrieve this data and provide it to frontend applications. A well-designed API will:
- Enable seamless access to agent and launch data for users.
- Provide a scalable and secure interface for future integrations.
- Reduce friction for developers building on the ÆGENTS ecosystem.

---

## Technical Specification
The API will be designed as a RESTful and/or GraphQL interface, optimized for decentralized data access and blockchain compatibility. Key features include:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Fetch metadata and content from IPFS/Filecoin.
   - Retrieve on-chain metadata (e.g., Content Identifiers or CIDs).

2. **Endpoints**:
   - `GET /agents`: Retrieve a list of agents, including metadata and performance stats.
   - `GET /agents/{id}`: Fetch details of a specific agent.
   - `GET /launches`: Retrieve a list of launches, including associated data.
   - `GET /launches/{id}`: Fetch details of a specific launch.

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - **Backend Framework**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js or Fastify.
   - **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.js/Ethers.js for fetching on-chain data.
   - **Data Caching**: Utilize Redis or similar for efficient caching of frequently accessed data.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Token-based or wallet-based authentication for API access.
   - Optional integration with DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for user identity.

5. **Decentralization**:
   - Use IPFS gateways and Filecoin retrieval endpoints to load data.
   - Implement fallbacks to ensure data availability.

**Example Workflow**:
1. User requests agent data from the frontend.
2. The frontend queries the API for the required agent/launch data.
3. The API retrieves the data from IPFS/Filecoin (via CID) and returns it to the frontend.

## Funding Request
- **Total Requested Amount**: 5,000,000 AEGNT
- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Design API architecture and develop basic endpoints (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: API documentation, base implementation, and test environment.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Integrate decentralized storage and on-chain metadata retrieval (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully functional integration with IPFS/Filecoin and smart contracts.
  3. **Milestone 3**: Finalize API with performance optimizations and security hardening (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Production-ready API with stress testing and authentication mechanisms.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Design API architecture, define endpoints, and implement a prototype backend.
2. **Week 2**: Integrate IPFS/Filecoin for data retrieval and link to on-chain metadata.
3. **Week 3**: Implement authentication, caching, and scalability features.
4. **Week 4**: Finalize documentation, conduct testing, and deploy the API to production.

## Impact
The API will:
- Provide seamless and secure access to decentralized agent and launch data.
- Enable rapid development of frontend applications for the ÆGENTS ecosystem.
- Serve as the foundation for additional integrations, such as analytics or monitoring tools.
- Strengthen ÆGENTS' position as a leader in decentralized, autonomous agent frameworks.
