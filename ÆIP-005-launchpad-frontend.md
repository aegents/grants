## Summary
This proposal outlines the development of the Launchpad and Wallet functionality for the ÆGENTS ecosystem. The Launchpad will enable users to create, view, and interact with funding campaigns (launches), while the Wallet functionality will integrate a blockchain wallet library for seamless on-chain interactions. The Launchpad will also display progress for funding campaigns in a visually appealing and informative way.

---

## Motivation
The ÆGENTS ecosystem requires a dedicated Launchpad to facilitate funding campaigns for agents. Additionally, blockchain wallet integration is critical for enabling users to interact with the platform securely and efficiently. This functionality will:
- Empower users to participate in agent funding campaigns directly through the platform.
- Provide a clear overview of campaign progress.
- Simplify on-chain interactions with an intuitive wallet interface.

## Technical Specification
1. **Launchpad Features**:
   - **Campaign Overview Page**:
     - Display all active campaigns with details such as title, description, funding goal, and progress.
     - Filtering and search functionality to help users find specific campaigns.
   - **Individual Campaign Page**:
     - Show detailed information about the campaign, including funding progress (e.g., percentage raised, contributors, time remaining).
     - Include a contribution form for users to participate directly.
   - **Progress Visualization**:
     - Use progress bars, charts, or graphs to visually represent funding status.

2. **Wallet Integration**:
   - Use a blockchain wallet library (e.g., **web3modal**, **Ethers.js**, or **WalletConnect**) to enable:
     - Connecting user wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom).
     - Viewing wallet balances.
     - Sending transactions (e.g., contributing to a campaign).
   - Support major blockchain networks used by the ÆGENTS ecosystem.

3. **Reusable Components**:
   - Progress bars, modals for wallet interactions, and contribution forms.
   - Tables and lists for displaying contributors and campaign details.

4. **Integration with API**:
   - Fetch campaign and funding data dynamically from the backend API.
   - Ensure real-time updates for funding progress using WebSockets or polling.

- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Develop the campaign overview page and integrate wallet library (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully functional campaign overview with wallet connection.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Implement individual campaign page with funding progress visualization (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Progress bars, contribution forms, and funding data integration.
  3. **Milestone 3**: Finalize UI/UX design, optimize wallet functionality, and conduct usability testing (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Polished Launchpad and Wallet functionality ready for production.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Build the campaign overview page and integrate a blockchain wallet library for connection and basic transactions.
2. **Week 2**: Develop individual campaign pages with detailed funding progress and contribution functionality.
3. **Week 3**: Finalize the design, test wallet integration across devices, and deploy the feature.
