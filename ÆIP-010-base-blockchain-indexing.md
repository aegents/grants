## Summary
This proposal outlines the development of a Base Blockchain Indexing system for the ÆGENTS ecosystem. The system will include setting up archive nodes, transaction parsing, indexing all transfers, swaps, and transactions, and building an index of addresses, contracts, and other relevant blockchain data.

---

## Motivation
A robust blockchain indexing system is essential for enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis within the ÆGENTS ecosystem. By indexing blockchain data such as transfers, swaps, and transactions, this system will:
- Provide a foundational database for analytics, querying, and reporting.
- Enhance the functionality of ÆGENTS applications through fast and reliable data access.
- Support future integrations with advanced features such as tracking agent performance and contract activity.

## Technical Specification
1. **Archive Node Setup**:
   - Deploy and maintain blockchain archive nodes to access full historical data.
   - Ensure redundancy and high availability of nodes.
   - Support for Ethereum-compatible chains and other relevant networks.

2. **Transaction Parsing**:
   - Develop parsers to extract and categorize blockchain transactions, including:
     - Transfers (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721, native tokens).
     - Swaps (e.g., interactions with decentralized exchanges).
     - Contract interactions.
   - Implement validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

3. **Indexing**:
   - Create a scalable database for storing parsed data, including:
     - Transaction metadata (e.g., timestamps, gas fees, participants).
     - Address and contract activity logs.
     - Cross-references between addresses, contracts, and transaction types.
   - Use efficient indexing strategies to optimize query performance.

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Leverage tools such as PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, or similar for data storage and indexing.
   - Implement a modular architecture to allow future support for additional blockchains.
   - Integrate monitoring tools for node and database performance.

- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Set up archive nodes and basic transaction parsing (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully operational archive nodes and initial parsers for transfers and swaps.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Build a scalable database for indexing transactions and addresses (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Indexed database with transaction metadata, address logs, and contract interactions.
  3. **Milestone 3**: Finalize infrastructure, optimize performance, and deploy monitoring tools (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Production-ready indexing system with monitoring and performance optimizations.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Month 1**: Deploy archive nodes, configure environments, and implement basic parsers for transaction types.
2. **Month 2**: Develop the database schema, implement indexing logic, and populate the database with historical data.
3. **Month 3**: Optimize query performance, add monitoring tools, and deploy the system to production.
