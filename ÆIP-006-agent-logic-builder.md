## Summary
This proposal aims to develop the Agent Logic Builder, a frontend tool for users to create structured logic for agents. The builder will allow users to define agent backstory, personality, objectives, and sequences using plain text inputs. The tool will parse these inputs, validate them, and generate structured logic files that agents can interpret. It will include error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure users create accurate and functional logic.

---

## Motivation
Agents require structured logic to operate effectively. Creating this logic manually can be complex and error-prone. The Agent Logic Builder simplifies this process by providing an intuitive interface for users to define logic in plain text, which is then parsed and validated. This functionality will:
- Empower users to customize their agents without requiring technical expertise.
- Reduce errors in agent logic creation through built-in validation and error handling.
- Streamline the process of generating structured logic files for agents.

## Technical Specification
1. **Frontend Features**:
   - **Form-Based Inputs**:
     - Backstory: Text input for defining the agent’s background and context.
     - Personality: Dropdowns, sliders, or free text to set traits and behaviors.
     - Objectives: Text input or checklist to specify agent goals.
     - Sequences: Step-by-step logic in a structured or free-text format.
   - **Error Handling and Validation**:
     - Ensure inputs conform to predefined formats (e.g., character limits, required fields).
     - Highlight errors with tooltips or inline messages.
   - **Preview and Parsing**:
     - Display a real-time preview of the generated structured logic.
     - Parse plain text inputs into a standardized JSON or similar format.

2. **Integration**:
   - **Logic Parsing**:
     - Use a parser to convert plain text into structured logic the agents can interpret.
   - **Validation**:
     - Build validation functions to catch syntax errors or missing fields.
   - **Output**:
     - Save structured logic files in JSON or another compatible format for backend integration.

3. **Reusable Components**:
   - Input fields, validation handlers, preview components, and error modals.
   - Styling with TailwindCSS for consistency and rapid development.

## Funding Request
- **Total Requested Amount**: 5,000,000 AEGNT
- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Develop form inputs and basic parsing functionality (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Form fields for backstory, personality, objectives, and sequences with basic validation.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Implement advanced parsing, validation, and error handling (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully functional parser with error highlighting and real-time feedback.
  3. **Milestone 3**: Finalize UI/UX design and integrate output generation (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Polished interface, structured logic export functionality, and user documentation.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Month 1**: Develop the form inputs for all logic aspects (backstory, personality, objectives, sequences) and implement basic parsing functionality.
2. **Month 2**: Build advanced validation and error handling mechanisms. Enhance parsing to handle edge cases.
3. **Month 3**: Finalize the user interface, implement structured logic export, and conduct usability testing.

## Impact
The Agent Logic Builder will:
- Simplify the process of creating agent logic, making it accessible to non-technical users.
- Ensure high-quality logic files through validation and error handling.
- Enhance customization and functionality for agents, driving user engagement in the ÆGENTS ecosystem.
- Provide a scalable and reusable interface for future extensions.

## Additional Notes
- Relevant technologies: Svelte, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, JSON parsing libraries.
- Potential collaborators: Frontend developers, UX designers, and backend developers for validation logic.
- Future extensions: Integration with a library of predefined agent templates, AI-assisted suggestions for logic creation, and multilingual support.
