## Summary
This proposal aims to implement a decentralized storage solution for the ÆGENTS ecosystem using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Filecoin. The storage system will securely and transparently host agent configurations and launch data, laying the foundation for future API integration to access this information.

---

## Motivation
Currently, there is no standardized or decentralized storage system for managing agent and launch data. Implementing a decentralized solution ensures data integrity, security, and availability while aligning with ÆGENTS' vision of a fully decentralized ecosystem. IPFS and Filecoin provide a robust, scalable, and cost-effective method to store and retrieve static data with high reliability.

---

## Technical Specification
- **Storage Backend**: Use IPFS for content-addressable, peer-to-peer storage and Filecoin for long-term, persistent storage.
- **Data Format**: Agent configurations and launch data will be stored as JSON files with a standardized schema for interoperability.
- **Access**: Data will be retrievable via IPFS gateways and Filecoin retrieval miners, with future API integration for seamless querying.
- **Architecture**:
  1. **IPFS Node Deployment**: Deploy and maintain dedicated IPFS nodes to manage file uploads and retrievals.
  2. **Filecoin Integration**: Use Filecoin deals to ensure persistence and incentivize storage providers.
  3. **Metadata Management**: Store metadata (e.g., agent and launch identifiers) on-chain to link to the IPFS/Filecoin storage system.

**Example Workflow**:
1. Agent data (e.g., `agent.json`) is uploaded to IPFS.
2. The CID (Content Identifier) is stored in a smart contract for immutability.
3. Filecoin deals are made to ensure long-term storage.
4. Data retrieval occurs via IPFS gateways or direct Filecoin miners.

## Funding Request
- **Total Requested Amount**: 5,000,000 AEGNT
- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  1. **Milestone 1**: Setup and configure IPFS nodes (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Fully functional IPFS node cluster, CID management system.
  2. **Milestone 2**: Implement Filecoin storage deals (1,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Persistent storage contracts on Filecoin, integration scripts.
  3. **Milestone 3**: On-chain metadata integration (2,000,000 AEGNT)
     - Deliverables: Smart contracts for CID linking.

---

## Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Deploy IPFS nodes, configure gateways, and validate file uploads/retrievals.
2. **Week 2**: Integrate Filecoin for persistence and test retrieval from miners.
3. **Week 3**: Develop and deploy smart contracts to link on-chain metadata with CIDs.
4. **Week 4**: Finalize system, conduct testing.

## Impact
Implementing this decentralized storage system will:
- Enable secure and reliable storage of agent and launch data.
- Align the ÆGENTS ecosystem with decentralized principles.
- Provide a foundation for future API integrations and seamless data access.
- Enhance user trust by ensuring data integrity and availability.
